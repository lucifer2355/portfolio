#### Intro

I am a co-founder of [Aoroxa](https://aoroxa.com/) where I work on engineering infrastructure and build tools to price fine art. My primary job functions are as a software engineer.
<br>
I am available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in social impact, education, inclusivity, and space. I enjoy advising companies and may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the time commitment and the project. If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in Ahmedabad but travel to the Bangalore Bay Area frequently.
<br><br>

#### Currently

At Aoroxa I have learned how to build teams and manage people, build relationships with customers, sell enterprise products, and build on-line predictive models for production environments. I've also learned how to build and maintain large web applications & mobile application (see [aoroxa.com](https://aoroxa.com/)).

#### Some history

- I was introduced to computer when I was 9. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Road Rash, GTA Vice City, and Midtown Madness. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.

- At 10, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.
- At 14, I built my first webpage with HTML.
- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires 3.
- At 17, I took my first programm writen in c .

- At 20, I remember 8 February 2019 the day of my 1st job interview at [Codrain Technolab.](https://www.codraintechnolabs.com/)

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.

<!-- - We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email. -->

<!-- - In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much. -->

<!-- - At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II. -->

<!-- - I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs. -->

<!-- - When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable. -->

<!-- - At 17, I went to college  and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have tangentially worked on two more. -->

<!-- - At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later. -->

<!-- - At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year. -->

<!-- - At 18, In the summer before college, my friends and I started playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)">Muggle Quidditch</a>. We went on to start over 8 teams in the [International Quidditch Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quidditch_Association) including the [Buffalo Quidditch Society](https://www.facebook.com/buffaloquidditch/). At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on facebook. -->
